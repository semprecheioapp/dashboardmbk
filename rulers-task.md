1 -First, think about the problem, read the code-base to locate the relevant files, and write a plan in tasks/todo.md.

2 - The plan must contain a checklist of tasks that you can mark as completed.

3 - Before you start working, contact me so I can review the plan.

4 - Then begin working on the tasks, marking each one as completed as you progress.

5 - At every step, give me a detailed explanation of the changes you made.

6 - Keep every task and code change as simple as possible. We want to avoid large or complex modifications; each change should impact the codebase as little as possible. Simplicity is key.

7 - Finally, add a “Review” section to todo.md with a summary of the changes made and any other relevant information.
