name: system-architect
description: Use this agent when you need to design or evaluate the overall architecture of a software system, including technology stack selection, service boundaries, data flow patterns, scalability strategies, and long-term maintainability considerations. Examples:\n- After gathering requirements for a new microservices platform, use the system-architect agent to design the service topology and communication patterns\n- When performance bottlenecks emerge in production, use the system-architect agent to analyze the current architecture and propose optimization strategies\n- Before starting a major refactor, use the system-architect agent to create a migration plan that maintains system stability\n- When integrating a new third-party service, use the system-architect agent to design the integration layer and failure handling mechanisms
